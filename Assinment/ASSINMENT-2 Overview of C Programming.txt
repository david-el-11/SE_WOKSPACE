1 Overview of C Programming
THEORY: History and Evolution of C Programming

C programming language was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at Bell Laboratories. It was created to develop the UNIX operating system. C evolved from earlier languages such as BCPL and B.

C became popular because it combines the features of both high-level and low-level languages. It allows direct memory access using pointers while still being easy to read and write. Over time, C influenced many modern languages such as C++, Java, C#, and Python.

mportance of C Language

Fast execution speed

Portability

System-level programming

Used in OS, compilers, embedded systems

Why C is Still Used Today

Core language for operating systems

Embedded systems development

Game engines

Database systems

2. #include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}

3. Basic Structure of a C Program
THEORY

A C program consists of:

Header files

main() function

Variables & data types

Statements

Return statement

+--------------------+
| Header Files       |
+--------------------+
| main() Function    |
| Variables          |
| Statements         |
| return 0;          |
+--------------------+

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int age = 20;
    float marks = 85.5;
    char grade = 'A';

    printf("Age: %d\n", age);
    printf("Marks: %.2f\n", marks);
    printf("Grade: %c", grade);

    return 0;
}

4. Operators in C
THEORY

Types of Operators:

Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %)

Relational (>, <, ==)

Logical (&&, ||, !)

Assignment (=, +=)

Increment/Decrement (++ , --)

Bitwise (&, |)

Conditional (? :)

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int a, b;
    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);

    printf("Sum: %d\n", a + b);
    printf("Greater: %d\n", a > b);
    printf("Logical AND: %d\n", a && b);

    return 0;
}

5. Control Flow Statements
THEORY

Decision-making statements:

if

if-else

nested if

switch

Even or Odd + Month Name

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int n, m;
    scanf("%d", &n);

    if(n % 2 == 0)
        printf("Even\n");
    else
        printf("Odd\n");

    scanf("%d", &m);
    switch(m)
    {
        case 1: printf("January"); break;
        case 2: printf("February"); break;
        default: printf("Invalid");
    }
    return 0;
}

6. Looping in C
THEORY
Loop	Use
for	Fixed iterations
while	Condition based
do-while	Executes at least once

1 to 10 using Loops

int i=1;
while(i<=10){ printf("%d ", i++); }

Reverse Number

int n, rev=0;
while(n>0){
 rev = rev*10 + n%10;
 n/=10;
}

7. Loop Control Statements
THEORY

break – exits loop

continue – skips iteration

goto – jumps to label

for(int i=1;i<=10;i++){
 if(i==3) continue;
 if(i==5) break;
 printf("%d ", i);
}

8. Functions in C
THEORY

Functions improve reusability and modularity.

int fact(int n){
 if(n==0) return 1;
 return n*fact(n-1);
}

9. Arrays in C
THEORY

Arrays store multiple values of same type.

int a[5]={1,2,3,4,5};

10. Pointers in C
THEORY

Pointers store address of variables.

int a=10;
int *p=a;
*p=20;
printf("%d", a);

11. Strings in C
THEORY

String functions: strlen(), strcpy(), strcat(), strcmp()

char s1[20], s2[20];
strcat(s1, s2);

12. Structures in C
THEORY

Structures store different data types.

struct student{
 char name[20];
 int roll;
 float marks;
};

File Handling in C
THEORY

File handling stores data permanently.

FILE *fp;
fp = fopen("test.txt","w");
fprintf(fp,"Hello C");
fclose(fp);
.
